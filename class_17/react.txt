Fortunately, Facebook has created Create React App, an environment that comes pre-configured with everything you need to build a React app. It will create a live development server, use Webpack to automatically compile React, JSX, and ES6, auto-prefix CSS files, and use ESLint to test and warn about mistakes in the code.


Create React App is very good for getting started for beginners as well as large-scale enterprise applications, but it's not perfect for every workflow. You can also create your own Webpack setup for React.
